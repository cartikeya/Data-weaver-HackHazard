Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly important in a world filled with distractions. This concept is not new, as it was first introduced by Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argued that to advance your understanding of a field, you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your attention to uncover the truth latent in each. He emphasized the importance of intense concentration in learning and mastering complicated material. This idea was ahead of its time, and it would take academia another seven decades to formalize the concept of deep work.
