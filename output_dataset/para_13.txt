The concept of deep work is supported by research in performance psychology, which began to explore what separates experts from others in the 1970s. K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, coined the term "deliberate practice" to describe the process of focused attention and concentration that experts use to improve their performance. Deliberate practice involves a lifelong period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain, and it's the key to mastering cognitively demanding tasks. By dedicating time to deep work and deliberate practice, individuals can quickly learn hard things and achieve expertise in their field.
