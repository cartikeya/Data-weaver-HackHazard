The dataset size is another crucial factor in linguistic analysis, as it determines the scope and breadth of the text being examined. A larger dataset size provides a more comprehensive and representative sample of language use, allowing researchers to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent in smaller datasets. In the case of a docx content with a dataset size of 5, the analysis may be limited to a specific section or chapter of the text, rather than the entire document. Nevertheless, even a small dataset size can still yield valuable insights into the linguistic characteristics of the text, such as the frequency of certain words or phrases, the use of grammatical structures, and the overall tone and style of the writing. By analyzing a dataset of this size, researchers can develop a nuanced understanding of the text's linguistic features and make informed decisions about how to improve its clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.
