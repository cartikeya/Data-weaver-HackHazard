Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly valuable in a world where distractions are plentiful. The concept of deep work is not new, and it has been recognized as a key factor in achieving success in various fields. As Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, wrote in his book The Intellectual Life, "Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea." This advice emphasizes the importance of intense concentration in mastering complicated material and quickly learning hard things.

The idea that deep work is essential for mastering cognitively demanding tasks is supported by research in psychology, particularly in the field of performance psychology. In the 1970s, psychologists began to study what separates experts from others, and in the 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, coined the term "deliberate practice" to describe the systematic and focused effort required to improve performance in a specific domain. Ericsson's work suggests that the differences between expert performers and normal adults are not innate, but rather the result of a lifelong period of deliberate effort to improve performance. This idea is consistent with Sertillanges's advice, which emphasizes the importance of intense concentration and focused attention in achieving success.

The concept of deep work is particularly relevant in today's world, where distractions are ubiquitous and it's easy to get sidetracked. With the rise of social media, email, and other digital technologies, it's becoming increasingly difficult to focus on a single task for an extended period. However, as Sertillanges and Ericsson's work suggests, deep work is essential for achieving success in many fields. By prioritizing deep work and minimizing distractions, individuals can improve their ability to focus and achieve their goals. This requires a deliberate effort to create an environment that supports deep work, such as setting aside dedicated time for focused work, eliminating distractions, and establishing clear goals and priorities.

In addition to its benefits for individual productivity and success, deep work also has broader implications for society. In a world where automation and artificial intelligence are increasingly prevalent, the ability to perform deep work is becoming a key factor in determining which jobs are most valuable and which skills are most in demand. As the economist Tyler Cowen has argued, the ability to perform deep work is one of the key factors that will distinguish the winners from the losers in the economy of the future. By prioritizing deep work and developing the skills and habits necessary to support it, individuals can position themselves for success in a rapidly changing world. This requires a commitment to lifelong learning, a willingness to adapt to new technologies and workflows, and a focus on developing the skills that are most valuable in a world where deep work is increasingly prized.
