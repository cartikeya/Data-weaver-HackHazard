The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare, as many people are constantly connected to the internet and social media. This can be a major obstacle to learning and achieving success, as it's difficult to focus on a task without distractions. However, by creating a schedule that includes large blocks of uninterrupted time, individuals can make deep work a priority. This can involve setting aside certain times of the day or week to focus on a specific task, and eliminating distractions during that time. By doing so, individuals can make significant progress on complex tasks and achieve a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Additionally, by prioritizing deep work, individuals can develop a sense of purpose and direction, which can help them stay motivated and focused on their goals.
