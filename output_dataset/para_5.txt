In a world filled with distractions, the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly valuable. Deep work refers to the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's a skill that's essential for anyone who wants to achieve success in their field. With the rise of social media, email, and other digital distractions, it's becoming harder and harder to find the time and space to focus on meaningful work. However, by cultivating the ability to perform deep work, individuals can improve their productivity, increase their sense of fulfillment, and make meaningful contributions to their field. The concept of deep work was first introduced by Cal Newport, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University, who argues that the ability to perform deep work is becoming a rare and valuable skill in a world that's increasingly dominated by distractions.
