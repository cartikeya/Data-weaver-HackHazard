Deep work is a concept that allows individuals to quickly learn hard things by focusing their attention and concentrating on a specific task without distractions. This idea is supported by Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, who wrote that to advance one's understanding of a field, one must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing their "converging rays of attention" to uncover the truth latent in each. In other words, Sertillanges argues that to learn requires intense concentration, which is a fact that was later formalized by academia in the 1970s through the study of performance psychology.
