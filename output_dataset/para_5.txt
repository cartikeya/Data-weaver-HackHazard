The concept of deep work was formalized in the 1970s, when a branch of psychology called performance psychology began to explore what separates experts from everyone else. In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, coined the term "deliberate practice" to describe the process of focused attention and effort that experts use to improve their performance. Ericsson argued that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain. This concept of deliberate practice is closely related to deep work, as it requires the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. By cultivating deep work habits, individuals can improve their ability to learn and master complicated material, and ultimately achieve expert-level performance in their field.
