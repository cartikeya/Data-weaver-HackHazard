Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly valuable in a world where distractions are plentiful. The concept of deep work has been around for a while, with philosophers like Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges recognizing its importance in the early 20th century. Sertillanges argued that to advance your understanding of a field, you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your attention to uncover the truth latent in each. This idea is echoed in the concept of deliberate practice, which was formalized by K. Anders Ericsson in the 1990s. Deliberate practice involves a lifelong period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain, and it's the key to becoming an expert in any field. By focusing on deep work and deliberate practice, individuals can quickly learn hard things and achieve success in a distracted world.
