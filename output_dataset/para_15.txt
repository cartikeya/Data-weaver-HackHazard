Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly important in a world filled with distractions. The concept of deep work has been around for centuries, with philosophers and thinkers recognizing the importance of intense concentration in order to learn and master new skills. One such thinker is Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, who wrote about the importance of focus and concentration in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argued that to advance one's understanding of a field, one must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing for intense concentration and attention to uncover the truth latent in each. This idea is echoed in many forms throughout his book, and it's an idea that has been supported by modern research in psychology.
