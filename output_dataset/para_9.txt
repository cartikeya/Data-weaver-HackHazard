The size of the dataset is also an important consideration, as it can have a significant impact on the overall quality and effectiveness of the analysis. A larger dataset is often more comprehensive and representative, as it encompasses a wider range of data points and observations, and provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the subject matter. However, a larger dataset can also be more difficult to manage and analyze, as it requires more time and resources to process and interpret the data. In contrast, a smaller dataset may be more manageable and easier to analyze, but it may not provide the same level of comprehensiveness and representation as a larger dataset. The ideal size of the dataset will therefore depend on the specific needs and requirements of the analysis, as well as the resources and capabilities of the researcher or analyst. By selecting the optimal size of the dataset, it is possible to achieve a high level of vocabulary richness and complexity, while also ensuring that the analysis is manageable and effective.
