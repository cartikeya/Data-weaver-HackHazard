The concept of deliberate practice was formalized by K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, in the early 1990s. Ericsson's research showed that experts in various fields, such as music, sports, and chess, all engage in a specific type of practice that is focused, structured, and deliberate. This type of practice involves setting specific goals, receiving feedback, and continuously pushing oneself to improve. Ericsson's work has been influential in shaping our understanding of how people become experts, and it has implications for anyone looking to improve their performance in a particular domain. By adopting the principles of deliberate practice, individuals can develop the skills and expertise they need to succeed in their chosen field.
