The concept of deep work refers to the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, allowing individuals to learn and master complex skills quickly. This idea is rooted in the advice of Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, who emphasized the importance of intense concentration in learning and mastering complicated material. Sertillanges's advice, penned in the early twentieth century, was ahead of its time and would take academia decades to formalize, but it remains a crucial aspect of achieving success in a world filled with distractions. By dedicating themselves to deep work, individuals can make significant progress in their respective fields, unlocking new levels of understanding and expertise.
