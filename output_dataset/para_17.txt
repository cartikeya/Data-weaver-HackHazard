The concept of deep work is closely related to the idea of flow, which was first introduced by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a state of complete absorption in an activity, where one's skills and challenges are perfectly balanced. When in a state of flow, individuals are fully engaged and focused, and they often report feeling a sense of joy and satisfaction. Deep work can help individuals achieve a state of flow, as it allows them to focus on a task without distractions and make significant progress. By combining deep work with the principles of deliberate practice, individuals can take their skills to the next level and achieve a high level of mastery. This can be applied to a wide range of fields, from music and sports to science and technology.
