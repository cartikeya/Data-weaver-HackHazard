The concept of deep work is closely related to the idea of deliberate practice, which was introduced by K. Anders Ericsson in the 1990s. Deliberate practice refers to the systematic and intentional effort to improve performance in a specific domain, and it is characterized by intense concentration, feedback, and repetition. Ericsson's research shows that expert performers in various fields, such as music, sports, and chess, have achieved their high level of performance through a lifelong period of deliberate practice. This suggests that deep work and deliberate practice are essential for mastering hard skills and achieving success in a rapidly changing world.
