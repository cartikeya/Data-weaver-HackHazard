Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly valuable in a world filled with distractions. The concept of deep work has been around for a long time, and it was first introduced by Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argued that to advance your understanding of your field, you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your attention to uncover the truth latent in each. This idea is supported by the concept of deliberate practice, which was introduced by K. Anders Ericsson in the 1990s. Deliberate practice refers to the systematic and intentional practice of a skill or task with the goal of improving performance. It involves focusing on the task at hand, without distraction, and receiving feedback on your performance. By engaging in deep work and deliberate practice, individuals can quickly learn hard things and improve their performance in a specific domain.
