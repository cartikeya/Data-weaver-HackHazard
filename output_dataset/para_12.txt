Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly valuable in a world filled with distractions. To achieve deep work, one must be able to concentrate intensely on a single task, allowing the "converging rays of attention" to uncover the truth latent in each topic. This idea is not new, as it was first proposed by Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argued that to advance one's understanding of a field, one must tackle the relevant topics systematically, requiring intense concentration.
