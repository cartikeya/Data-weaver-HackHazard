Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly important in a world filled with distractions. The concept of deep work is not new, and it has been discussed by various thinkers and philosophers throughout history. One such thinker is Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, who wrote about the importance of focus and concentration in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argues that to advance your understanding of a field, you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your attention to uncover the truth latent in each. This idea is supported by modern research in psychology, which has shown that experts in various fields owe their superior performance to a lifetime of deliberate practice.
