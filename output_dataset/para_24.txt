Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly valuable in a world where distractions are plentiful. The concept of deep work is not new, and it has been discussed by various thinkers throughout history, including Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy. Sertillanges wrote a book titled The Intellectual Life, which provides guidance on how to develop and deepen one's mind, and he emphasizes the importance of intense concentration in order to learn and master complicated material. His ideas are still relevant today, and they have been supported by modern research in psychology, which has shown that deliberate practice is essential for becoming an expert in a particular field.
