The idea of deep work was ahead of its time, and it took academia several decades to formalize the concept. In the 1970s, a branch of psychology called performance psychology began to explore what separates experts from others, and in the 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, coined the term "deliberate practice" to describe the process of focused attention and effort that experts use to improve their performance. Ericsson's work built on the idea that the differences between expert performers and normal adults are not immutable, but rather reflect a lifelong period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain. This concept of deliberate practice is closely related to deep work, as it requires individuals to focus without distraction on a specific task in order to improve their performance.
