Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly important in a world filled with distractions. The concept of deep work has been around for centuries, with philosophers like Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges recognizing the importance of intense concentration in mastering complicated material. Sertillanges argued that to advance your understanding of a field, you must tackle relevant topics systematically, allowing your attention to uncover the truth latent in each. This idea is supported by modern research in performance psychology, which has identified deliberate practice as a key factor in separating experts from everyone else. Deliberate practice involves a lifelong period of effort to improve performance in a specific domain, and it requires the ability to focus without distraction.
