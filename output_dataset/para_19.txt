Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task, and it's becoming increasingly important in a world filled with distractions. It allows individuals to quickly learn hard things and master complicated material, which is essential for making a living in the world of ideas. The concept of deep work is not new, as it was first introduced by Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges, a Dominican friar and professor of moral philosophy, in his book The Intellectual Life. Sertillanges argued that to advance one's understanding of a field, it's necessary to tackle relevant topics systematically, allowing for intense concentration and the uncovering of truth latent in each topic.
