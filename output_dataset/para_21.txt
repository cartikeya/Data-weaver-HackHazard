The concept of deep work was first introduced by Cal Newport, a professor at Georgetown University, who argued that the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare in a world filled with distractions. Newport's book, "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World," provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and practices of deep work, and offers practical advice on how to incorporate more deep work into your daily routine. One of the key principles of deep work is the idea of scheduling large blocks of uninterrupted time, which can be used to focus on complex and challenging tasks. This can be as simple as setting aside a few hours each day to work on a project without checking email or social media, or as complex as scheduling entire days or weeks to focus on a single task.
